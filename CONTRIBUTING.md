# Contributing to Transcriptase

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/BerkeAras/WorkGroup/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Committing Changes

**Great Commits** should be in this format:

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

-   Types
    -   **feat**: A new feature
    -   **fix**: A bug fix
    -   **docs**: Documentation only changes
    -   **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    -   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    -   **perf**: A code change that improves performance
    -   **test**: Adding missing tests
    -   **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
-   Scopes
    -   For example a specific component (e. g. sidebar, signin-provider, ...)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Use [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)

-   2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
-   You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
